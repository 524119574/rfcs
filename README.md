# Serum RFCs

[![Discord Chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/739225212658122886?color=blueviolet)](https://discord.com/channels/739225212658122886)

Substantial Serum changes, including feature development and new products are put through an
RFC (request for comments) process.

Similar to [other](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) processes, Serum RFCs hopes
to provide a shared forum to foster discussion and debate among all Serum stake holders so that
the community can be confident about the direction the ecosystem is evolving in.

### Writing a new RFC

Use the RFC template and open a pull request. Once reviewed and
approved by the maintainers, it will be added to [Serum Academy](https://serum-academy.com/en/serum-dex/)
and development should begin. All the sections in the template are optional, so use your judgement. But
please follow the formatting and file naming conventions used by existing RFCs.

### Editing an existing RFC

Typos, minor fixes, and major changes discovered after implementing an RFC should be merged through the
pull request workflow.

### Commenting

Commenting on current RFCs is open to everyone. To comment on a merged RFC, open an issue citing the RFC number.

### Should I make an RFC?

If you're thinking about writing an RFC, go for it!

The hope is for anyone who's interested in Serum, including but not limited to the DEX, will
use this as a community hub. Want to build an AMM using the Serum pool primitive? Write an
RFC. Want to add a new UI component to the [Serum DEX UI](https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex-ui?)?
Write an RFC. Have an idea but can't develop it yourself? Write an RFC. If it's worth doing, the community will
help you find a team to implement it.

Of course if you're making something that's not affecting existing projects, you don't need
to follow this process. However, if you care about community feedback and buy in, it's
recommended.

For small, repo specific issues like bug reports, please file issues directly in the associated
repo.

### Questions

If you have any questions about the process at all, feel free to ask in the Serum community Discord
linked above.
